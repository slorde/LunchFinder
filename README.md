The project was develop using java 11 on spring tool suit, it was a simple java project.

I kept the csv files so I could demonstrate on the DataManager class how I read and populate the Restaurants/Cousine data

To test the project I create junit test cases that do the search on the given files.

To be easier to test executing the project, I create a simple jpanel just to show the results given filters.

The main search class is the SearchRestaurants.java

To execute tests -> Run as junit test on the tests folder
To execute the project panel -> Run as java application on the project name

in folder dist there is a runnable for the project
